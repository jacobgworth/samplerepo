						<p>
							Bob and Sharon had the vision and foresight to purchase a piece of barren land just north of Port au Prince. Their vision was for the land to be developed into a missions complex that would reach out and minister to the needs of the less fortunate people in Haiti. The Mission of Hope would not be where it is today without their hard work and dedication to serving and touching lives in Haiti for Christ. Bob and Sharon continue to be actively involved in raising funds to support the ministries at Mission of Hope. They also bring Missions groups several times a year so people with a heart for missions can experience Haiti firsthand. Bob and Sharon’s son and daughter-in-law, Brad and Vanessa Johnson continue the vision as the Mission of Hope Director and President.

					<div class="staffBio">
						<p>
							Diana graduated from Florida State University with a double major in Spanish and International Affairs. Upon graduation, she joined Teach for America and taught for two years. Then, in September of 2009, Diana and her husband Jay felt the call the move to Haiti and were forever changed. A few months later, the earthquake hit, and a little while after, Jay and Diana found themselves sleeping in a tent at Mission of Hope and thought they would be there for just a few days. Those few days turned into almost two years, as they quickly realized that Mission of Hope was doing exactly what they were passionate about: loving and empowering Haitians.
						</p>
						<p>Soon after, Diana began translating and coordinating patient care in the Mission of Hope Prosthetics Lab. She loved working in the lab so much that she thought she’d go back to school to be a prosthetist! But the Lord quickly revealed that it was mostly the patients that made her love her job so much, and she had a deep desire to create jobs for the amputee women she grew so closely with. Always crafty at heart, Diana (along with her husband Jay and the help of many, many others) founded 3 Cords as an initiative to empower these Haitian women and show them that they are talented and valuable. Jay and Diana are now in California as Jay is getting his MBA, but they both hope to return to live in Haiti one day soon.</p>

And one time, he turned 21. After that, he felt as if he was sucked into a space/time continuum which inevitably lead him to Haiti's shores. After six months and an earthquake, he awoke one morning in a tent, under Wall-E bed-sheets on Mission of Hope's front lawn. Brad offered him the position of MOH Emperor which was adamantly denied due to being extremely overqualified. Thus he humbly accepted the role of running Lespwa Means Hope to reach out and connect students to what is going on at MOH.

After spending 3 years in the program she knew that sharing the gospel to the ends of the earth is what truly made her come alive. In 2009 she felt the Lord calling her to Arkansas, so without any real explanation she took a leap of faith and obeyed the gentle whisper to go. She started working with the college ministry at the church she attended and joined the executive staff with a focus on discipleship and mentoring. Little did she know that her new church had a deep connection with Mission of Hope and a real love for the people of Haiti. In May on 2011 she came to Haiti for the first time on a weeklong trip. It didn’t take long for her to know that this is where the Lord had always intended her to be and He had been setting things into motion long before she knew it. She is definitely looking forward to taking over group trip coordinating and having the opportunity to work with Mission of Hope.
