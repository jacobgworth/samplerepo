				The Clinic of Hope currently consists of a fully operational outpatient clinic, mobile clinic, prosthetics lab, and a community health program, and is amidst an expansion into a hospital focused on emergency care and maternal health. Our desire is to minister through patient education and the relief of suffering to as many patients as possible. Our mission is to fight the health risks Haitians face by serving through local churches and schools with on-going mobile clinics and community health initiatives, as we leverage these services to expand our Gospel impact in these communities.
