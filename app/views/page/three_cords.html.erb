		<img class="alignRight" src="/assets/icon-3Cords-med.png" />	3 Cords is a small business initiative that started in 2010 after the devastating earthquake left many people without limbs and without jobs.
3 Cords employs amputee women and mothers of amputee children, giving them hope that they are still whole, valuable, and precious. Our vision is to love and serve these women, teach them valuable skills, and provide them with dignity that they can still work and provide for their families. In Haiti, many people do not believe amputees can do anything, let alone work. 3 Cords is disproving this cultural stigma for sure!

<h2>Where does the name 3 Cords come from?</h2>

<p>One reason is that our main product is a braided headband. However, the main reason can be understood from Ecclesiastes 4:9-12.
"Two are better than one...If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up...Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken."</p>
