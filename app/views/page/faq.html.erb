<p>Below is a list of the most commonly asked questions to Mission of Hope. If you have specific questions about Child Sponsorship or Mission Trips please visit the <a href="../sponsor_faq">Child Sponsorship FAQs </a> or <a href="../mission_trips">Mission Trips FAQs</a> pages.</p>
<div id="accordion">
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> How do I create an account online?</a></p>
<div>
<p>If you would like to create an account with us online, click on &ldquo;My MOH&rdquo; on the top right corner. Under the &ldquo;Welcome Guest&rdquo; heading on the left, click &ldquo;Register&rdquo; and enter the required information. Click &ldquo;Register&rdquo; again, and now you have made your account with MOH!</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> Why does it still say &ldquo;Welcome Guest&rdquo; even after I have registered or logged onto my existing account?</a></p>
<div>
<p>This is the way our donor system is setup. Even though you have registered or logged on, it will still say &ldquo;Welcome Guest&rdquo; at the top. The way you can tell if you are logged in is if you scroll to the bottom of the page and you see the heading &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; at the bottom left. Here you can view your account, change your password, and view your gifts and pledges.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> What should I do if I forget my password?</a></p>
<div>
<p>Enter the email address associated with your account in the log in box, and click the link underneath that will send an email to you with a new, temporary password. Once you&rsquo;ve logged on with your temporary password, you can change your password back to what you would like it to be using the &ldquo;Change Password&rdquo; link under the &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; heading.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> How do I make a donation to Mission of Hope online?</a></p>
<div>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never made an account with us before, you will go through the steps illustrated above to create your account. Once logged on, you will see the heading &ldquo;Donations&rdquo; on the left hand side of the screen. Click on whichever fund you would like to donate to. Enter the amount you would like to give, the frequency of the gift (one time, monthly, or annually), and enter your credit card information. Our website accepts Visa, Mastercard and Discover. Please enter any details that we need to know about your gift in the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; box. If you can&rsquo;t find a link to the exact fund you are looking to give to, such as an intern not listed on the website, you can click on the &ldquo;General Fund&rdquo; link, entering the specifics in the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; box. If you set up a reoccurring gift and would like it taken out on a specific date of the month, please contact our office and we will be more than happy to set it to whatever date is best for you. Our system will not do this automatically.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> Can I send a donation via check to Mission of Hope?</a></p>
<div>
<p>Yes, you can definitely do that! Any check donations can be sent to our stateside address at: Mission of Hope, PO Box 60004, Fort Myers FL 33906. Please make sure to include any details about the gift in the memo line of your check.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> How should I donate to Mission of Hope as a Canadian citizen?</a></p>
<div>
<p>Mission of Hope has partnered with an organization called Speroway for our Canadian donors who would like to give and be able to receive tax-deductible receipts. Once logged on to our website, you can click the &ldquo;Canadian Donations&rdquo; link on the left hand side of the page which will take you directly to their page. Or, you can go directly to their website here: http://www.speroway.com/our-partners/international-partners/mission-of-hope. If you have any questions about gifts that you have given through Speroway, please contact them, as we do not have that information on file. If you would like to give directly through Mission of Hope and do not mind not receiving a tax-deductible receipt, you are welcome to do that!</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> Will I receive a receipt for my gift?</a></p>
<div>
<p>One-time gifts made online receive an electronic receipt via email; recurring monthly gifts will not receive a receipt each time. We mail monthly receipts to child sponsors, and yearly tax receipts for all gifts given during the year. If you would like a receipt emailed or mailed to you at any time, please let us know and we would be more than happy to do this for you.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure if my gift processed correctly. What should I do?</a></p>
<div>
<p>If you are not sure if your gift processed, or if you think you gift may have processed more than once, please call our office and we will be more than happy to let you know the status of your gift. If you believe that your one-time gift went through, but have not received an e-confirmation after a few minutes, then your gift more than likely did not process. If your gift is recurring, you will not receive an email confirmation each month it&rsquo;s processed.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> Is my mission trip payment, tax-deductible?</a></p>
<div>
<p>Unfortunately, no. Mission of Hope, Haiti does not offer a tax-deductible receipt for mission trip payments due to the fact that we are able to offer you a full refund if your trip is cancelled. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please do not hesitate to ask!</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> How do I get on your mailing list?</a></p>
<div>
<p>Once you have made an account with us and included a valid address, you will receive a quarterly newsletter in the mail. We also send e-newsletters every so often, so please include a valid email address when you make your account. If you would like to opt out of either of these at any time, please contact our office, and we would be more than happy to do this for you!</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> I would love for my church to get involved with Mission of Hope somehow. How do I go about starting this?</a></p>
<div>
<p>We love when churches decide to partner with us! If you are interested in partnering with Mission of Hope in any way, submit the <a href="../church_partner"> partnership request form</a> and someone from our Church Partnerships team will be in touch with you.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> How do I become an intern at Mission of Hope?</a></p>
<div>
<p>Please visit our <a href="../intern">page for more</a> information on how to become an intern!</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> Can I send a gift to a staff member or my sponsored child in Haiti?</a></p>
<div>
<p>Due to rising baggage fees and the growing number of sponsorships (praise the Lord!), we have reevaluated the guidelines of Sponsor Mail. Please utilize the items below in your communication with sponsors and supporters: <br /><br /></p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 50px;">
<li>Mailing letters, cards, photos, and/or small, flat items to the MOH US Office: PO Box 60004, Fort Myers, FL 33906. Envelopes should be no larger than 9&rdquo; x 12&rdquo; x &frac12;&rdquo;. No boxes of any size should be sent. Please clearly mark envelopes with your student&rsquo;s name and student number. Please refrain from sending your student money. $1 USD is a lot of money to a Haitian child and could put them at risk when they return home to their village after school.</li>
<li>Purchase a gift from our <a href="../gift_store">Online Gift Store</a> to be bought in Haiti and delivered in your name. Your money will help support the local economy in Haiti.</li>
<li><a href="../write_to_child">Send a letter online.</a></li>
</ol></div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> What is your Children&rsquo;s Gift Store?</a></p>
<div>
<p>Our Children&rsquo;s Gift Store is a great way to bless your sponsored student with a gift. The items are purchased in Haiti so it supports their economy, plus it enables us to save room in our staff suitcases for other needed items at the Mission.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Question -->
<p><a href="#"><strong>+</strong> What is 3 Cords?</a></p>
<div>
<p>We are so glad you asked! 3 Cords is a business operated by Haitian women with prosthetic limbs at Mission of Hope. They make and sell beautiful corded headbands, purses, and much more. These items are a big hit with teams who come to MOH, and they are growing in popularity in the States. Please go to their website at www.3cordshaiti.com to find out more information on buying 3 Cords items or hosting a 3 Cords party.</p>
