			Missions Trip Costs</h1>
		<p>
			Once arriving at our campus, Mission of Hope will provide all in-country transportation and logistics. We will also pick you or your team up from the airport and provide a drop-off to the airport at the end of the week.
		</p>
		<p>
			Payment of trip is due one month prior to your departure date. This is a deadline that allows us to prepare for in-country costs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Individuals/groups staying at the Missionâ€™s campus will be given a food list with required items to bring with them on their trip. The list allows Mission of Hope to continue to offer low mission trips cost, while continuing to feed our volunteers! This food will be used by Mission of Hope to prepare some meals for all visiting teams. View our current food/needs list.
