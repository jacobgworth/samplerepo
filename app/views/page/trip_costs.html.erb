			<h1><span class="eyebrow">MISSION OF HOPE HAITI </span> <br /> Missions Trip Costs</h1>
			<p>Once arriving at our campus, Mission of Hope will provide all in-country transportation and logistics. Each team and individual participant are responsible for purchasing their own airfare in and out of Port Au Prince (PAP). We will pick you or your team up from the airport and provide a drop-off to the airport at the end of the week.</p>
			
			<p>Individuals/groups staying with us will be given a list of required items to bring with them on their trip. This list allows Mission of Hope to continue to offer low Mission Trip costs, while continuing to feed and care for our volunteers! The food on the list will be used by Mission of Hope to prepare some of the meals for our visiting teams, and supplement many of the local Haitian meals that our teams enjoy. Please click <a href="/MOH-MT-Current-Food-List.pdf">here</a> to download the current list.</p>
