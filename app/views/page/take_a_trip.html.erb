				Every year, Mission of Hope houses hundreds of groups and individuals at its campus in the foothills of Titanyen, Haiti. These gracious volunteers visit for a week, answering a call to assist in bringing life transformation to the people of Haiti. Whether you’re an individual or someone looking to bring a group, short-term mission trips is a great way to experience the benefits of serving a community in need. 
			</p>

<p>The benefit of a week-long trip to Mission of Hope is three-fold:</p>
	<ol class="takeATripList">
		<li>Volunteers are able to serve the mission and surrounding communities through work projects and ministry.</li>
		<li>Volunteers are able to catch a glimpse of the need in Haiti, and see first-hand how Mission of Hope is responding.</li>
		<li>Volunteers are able to return to their home-country with tools necessary to impact the needs of their own community.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Regardless of your skills, there are ways for you to serve at Mission of Hope. Once you arrive on the ground, we’ll plan your week for you, aware of your skill set. Trips will include village ministry to our surrounding community and light, construction ministry.
