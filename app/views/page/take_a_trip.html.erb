<p>The benefit of a week-long trip to Mission of Hope is three-fold:</p>
	<ol class="takeATripList">
		<li>Volunteers are able to serve the mission and surrounding communities through work projects and ministry.</li>
		<li>Volunteers are able to catch a glimpse of the need in Haiti, and see first-hand how Mission of Hope is responding.</li>
		<li>Volunteers are able to return to their home-country with tools necessary to impact the needs of their own community.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Regardless of your skills, there are ways for you to serve at Mission of Hope. Once you arrive on the ground, weâ€™ll plan your week for you, aware of your skill set. Trips will include village ministry to our surrounding community and light, construction ministry.
